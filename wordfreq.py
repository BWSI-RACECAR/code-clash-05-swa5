Code Clash #5 - Frequency of Word (wordfreq.py)


Author: Carter Berlind

Difficulty Level: 2/10

Prompt: Bobby is friendly and looking for things that say hi to him. He even looks for 
it in other words. Create a program that, when given a string as input, then reports 
how many times “hi” appears either on its own or within a word.

Constraints: Hi should be found regardless of case. The letters must be directly next to each other.

Test Cases:
Input: “Look behind you!”;                  Output: 1
Input: “what word are you looking for”;     Output: 0
Input: “This should be fun”;                Output: 1
Input: “his job is to make people laugh”;   Output: 1
Input: “How high can his white dog hike”;   Output: 4
